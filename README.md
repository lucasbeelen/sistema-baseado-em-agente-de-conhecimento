# Knowledge-Based Expert System

A knowledge-based expert system developed for the Artificial Intelligence course at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). This system implements three different applications using artificial intelligence concepts and rule-based reasoning.

## 🚀 Features

The system includes three main applications:

### 1. Credit Risk Assessment
- Evaluates credit risk for bank customers
- Uses a decision tree based on multiple criteria:
  - Income level
  - Credit history
  - Debt level
- Provides detailed explanations for each decision
- Risk levels: High, Moderate, and Low

### 2. Medical Diagnosis System
- Interactive medical diagnosis through symptom analysis
- Implements a rule-based expert system
- Covers common conditions like:
  - COVID-19
  - Flu
  - Common cold
- Uses backward chaining for diagnosis

### 3. Mini Akinator
- Character guessing game
- Uses an expert system approach
- Currently includes characters:
  - Harry Potter
  - Rapunzel
  - Mickey Mouse

## 🛠️ Technologies
